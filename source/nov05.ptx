    <title>One last example</title>
    
    <p>
      During the summers, Sean sells Texas watermelons out of the
      back of a truck along Highway 3, near Taber, AB. 
      During the previous summer, he sold his watermelons for $15 each,
      and sold an average of 50 watermelons per day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sean hired group of students at the Dhillon School of Business to conduct a market research survey. 
      They found that for every $1 reduction in the price of his watermelons, 
      Sean would sell an additional 5 watermelons per day.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Let <m>x</m> amount by which Sean reduces the price of each watermelon.
      What is the correct formula for the revenue <m>R</m>, as a function of <m>x</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is the applied domain for <m>R(x)</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      At what price should Sean sell his watermelons in order to maximize revenue from his watermelon business?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      <em>Homework:</em> If it costs Sean $7.15 per watermelon to get his melons from a wholesaler,
      find a formula for the profit <m>P(x)</m> as a function of the reduction in price.
      At what price should Sean sell his melons if he wants to maximize profit, rather than revenue?
      Are you surprised by the answer?

    <title>And now for something new: tangent lines</title>
    
    <p>
      Recall: given a graph <m>y=f(x)</m> of a differentiable function <m>f</m>,
      the <term>tangent line</term> to the graph at a point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is
      <me>
        y = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The function whose graph gives the tangent line is called the <term>linearization</term>
      of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>:
      <me>
        \ell(x) = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)
      </me>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      An exercise: what is the linearization of <m>f(x)=x^2\sqrt{x-1}</m> at <m>2</m>?
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ell(x)=2+6(x-4)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ell(x)=4+6(x-2)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ell(x)=6+4(x-2)</m>
          </p>

        <p>
          The point of the tangent line (AKA linearization) is twofold:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                It's linear, and therefore simple.
              </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
              <p>
                As long as <m>\Delta x = x-c</m> is small,
                <m>\ell(x)</m> is a good approximation of <m>f(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          If <m>x = c + \Delta x</m>, and <m>y=f(x)</m>, we set:
          <md>
            <mrow>\Delta y \amp = f(x)-f(c) = f(c+\Delta x)-f(c)</mrow>
            <mrow>dy \amp = \ell(x)-\ell(c) = f'(c)\Delta x</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
    
        <p pause="yes">
          Note that if <m>f(x)=x</m>, we get <m>y=x</m>,
          and <m>dx = f'(c)\Delta x = \Delta x</m>, since <m>f'(x)=1</m>.
        </p>
    
        <p pause="yes">
          This means we can use <m>dx</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> interchangeably.
        </p>
    
        <p pause="yes">
          But the same is not true of <m>dy</m> and <m>\Delta y</m>!
          However, we <em>can</em> say that <m>\Delta y \approx dy</m>,
          if <m>\Delta x</m> is small.

    <title>An approximation</title>
    
    <p>
      <em>Problem:</em> Use linear approximation to estimate the value of <m>\sqrt{4.2}</m>.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      We will be finding the linearization <m>\ell(x)</m> of some function <m>f(x)</m>.
      What function should we use?
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=x^2</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=2x</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=\ln(x)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>


    <p pause="yes">
      We need to choose a point at which to compute the linearization.
      What point should we use? (i.e., what value of <m>c</m>?)
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is the <em>approximate</em> value of <m>\sqrt{4.2}</m>?
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Another example</title>

    <p>
      Approximate the value of <m>\sin(3)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suggestion: <m>3</m> is close to <m>\pi\approx 3.14</m>.

    <title>Differentials, again</title>
    
    <p>
      Given <m>y=f(x)</m>, and no particular point of interest,
      we write the differential of <m>y</m> as
      <me>
        dy = f'(x)\,dx
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      What is the differential of <m>y = \sin(x^3)</m>?
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = \cos(3x^2)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = \cos(3x^2)\,dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = 3x^2\cos(x^3)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = 3x^2\cos(x^3)\,dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Differentials will be important in the next unit,
      when we consider change of variables for integrals.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Differentials can also be used for <q>propogation of error</q> calculations.
      For example, the area of a circle is <m>A = \pi r^2</m>.
      Taking differentials gives <m>dA = 2\pi r\,dr</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      If we measure the radius of the circle to be 15 cm, 
      with a possible error in measurement of <m>\pm 0.1</m> cm,
      then the possible error in the calculated area is approximately
      <m>dA = 2\pi (15)(0.1) = 3\pi</m>.
