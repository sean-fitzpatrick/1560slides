    <title>Related rates problems</title>
    
    <p>
      Basic premise: if two or more quantities are related by an equation,
      and those quantities are <em>changing</em> (with time),
      then the rates at which they are changing will also be related.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Example:</em> in an ideal gas, pressure, volume, and temperature are related by the equation
      <me>
        PV = nRT
      </me>,
      where <m>n</m> and <m>R</m> are constants 
      (whose values we don't really care about, since this is math class, not chemistry).
    </p>

    <p>
      If all three quantities are changing with respect to time, we get
      <m>
        P(t)V(t)=nRT(t)
      </m>,
      and taking derivatives gives
      <m>
        P'(t)V(t)+P(t)V'(t)=nRT'(t)
      </m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Typical question: if temperature remains constant at <m>20^\circ</m> C,
      and the volume is increasing at a rate of 15 hogsheads per fortnight,
      at what rate is the pressure changing when the volume is 80 gallons?
    </p>

    <title>An actual example</title>
    
    <p>
      A spherical balloon is being inflated at a rate of 25 cm<m>^3</m> per second.
      At what rate is the radius of the balloon increasing when the volume is 100 cm<m>^3</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      First of all: what is the formula for the volume of a sphere?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> in terms of <m>r</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is the value of <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m> when <m>V=100</m>?
      <ol pause="yes" marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            Not possible to say, since we don't know <m>r</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\dfrac{1}{4\pi}\left(\dfrac{\pi}{75}\right)^{2/3}</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\dfrac{1}{4\pi}\left(\dfrac{\pi}{75}\right)^{2/3}(25)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Don't know; none of these answers are decimals

    <title>Another example</title>
    
    <p>
      A baseball diamond is a square with sides that are 90 feet in length.
    </p>

    <p>
      A batter hits the ball and runs toward first base at a speed of 20 feet per second.
    </p>

    <p>
      At what rate is the distance between the batter and second base changing when the batter is half way to first base?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      The relevant distances here:
      <ul pause="yes">
        <li>the distance between the batter and first base</li>
        <li>the distance between the batter and second base</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p pause="yes">
      What theorem will give us the relationship between these distances?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      At what rate is the distance to second base changing?
    </p>

    <title>One more example</title>
    
    <p>
      A spotlight is on the ground, 30 metres away from a tall building.
      A person, who is 2 metres tall, walks from the light toward the building at a speed of 1.5 metres per second.
    </p>

    <p>
      At what rate is the length of the person's shadow changing when they are 10 metres away from the building?
