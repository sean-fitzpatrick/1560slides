    <title>Recap: derivative as slope of tangent line</title>
    
    <p>
      Recall: the <term>derivative</term> of a function <m>f</m> is given by
      <me>
        f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition was motivated by finding the <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/x4hjqvfu">slope of a tangent line</url>.
      (We can also think of instantaneous velocity.)
    </p>

    <p>
      At a point <m>(c,f(c))</m> on a graph <m>y=f(x)</m>,
      the equation of the tangent line is
      <me>
        y = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)
      </me>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      The derivative also gives a <em>linear approximation</em>:
      for small <m>\Delta x</m>,
      <me>
        \Delta y = f(c+\Delta x)-f(c) \approx f'(c)\Delta x
      </me>.

    <title>Basic derivative rules</title>

    <p>
      Thus begins Unit 2. Goodbye, limits! (For now<ellipsis/>)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The limit definition of the derivative gives us great intuition,
      but it's not very practical.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      What if we wanted to find the derivative of <m>f(x)=5x^8-4x^5+2x^4-15x^3-8x+3</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
      Or <m>g(x)=\sin(\sqrt{x^4+7})</m>?

    <title>Simple functions</title>
    
    <p>
      For a constant function <m>f(x)=c</m>, what is <m>f'(x)</m>?

    <p pause="yes">
      For a linear function <m>f(x)=mx+b</m>, what is <m>f'(x)</m>?

  <slide>
    <title>Power functions</title>
    
    <p>
      We have seen the following so far (assuming we've been reading along in the textbook):
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=x</m> is <m>f'(x)=1</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=x^2</m> is <m>f'(x)=2x</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=x^3</m> is <m>f'(x)=3x^2</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}</m> is <m>f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}=\frac12 x^{-1/2}</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=\frac1x=x^{-1}</m> is <m>f'(x)=-\frac{1}{x^2}=-1x^{-2}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, what do you think we should get for the derivative of <m>f(x)=x^n</m>?
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Constant multiples</title>
    
    <p>
      If <m>g(x)=3f(x)</m>, what is the relationship between <m>g'(x)</m> and <m>f'(x)</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>f(x)=12x^{2/3}</m>, what is <m>f'(x)</m>?
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Sum and difference</title>
    
    <p>
      Consider functions <m>f(x) = ax+b</m> and <m>g(x)=cx+d</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is the derivative of <m>f+g</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      In general, the derivative of <m>f(x)+g(x)</m> is <m>f'(x)+g'(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      The same is true of differences, and the rule extends to sums/differences with three or more terms.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>A polynomial</title>
    
    <p>
      Earlier, we asked what the derivative might be for <m>f(x)=5x^8-4x^5+2x^4-15x^3-8x+3</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what is it? (Use the rules for powers, sums, and constant multiples.)
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Other common functions</title>
    
    <p>
      Here are derivatives of some other common functions.
      These can be determined using the limit definition.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m> is <m>f'(x)=\cos(x)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=\cos(x)</m> is <m>f'(x)=-\sin(x)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=e^x</m> is <m>f'(x)=e^x</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The derivative of <m>f(x)=\ln(x)</m> is <m>f'(x)=\dfrac1x</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      <term>Leibniz notation</term>: another notation for the derivative is as follows:
      if <m>y=f(x)</m>, we write <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      We can read <m>\dfrac{d}{dx}</m> as <q>the derivative of</q>. This allows us to shorten some statements:
      <me pause="yes">
        \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x))=\cos(x), \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x))=-\sin(x)
      </me>,
      <etc/>
