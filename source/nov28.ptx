    <title>Last time: Riemann sums</title>
    
    <p>
      Use Riemann sums to evaluate the integral <m>\di \int_0^3 (x^2-2x)\,dx</m>.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>There must be a better way!</title>
    
    <p>
      Didn't we mention last time that definite integrals are somehow related to antiderivatives?
    </p>

    <p>
      We did! If we know the velocity function <m>v(t)</m>, we can recover position, up to a constant:
      <me>
        x(t) = \int v(t)\,dt = F(t)+C
      </me>,
      for some antiderivative <m>F</m> of <m>v</m>, and some constant <m>C</m>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if we don't know <m>C</m>, we can still find the <em>change</em> in position,
      between time <m>t=a</m> and time <m>t=b</m>:
      <me>
        x(b)-x(a) = (F(b)+C)-(F(a)+C) = F(b)-F(a)
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      But <m>x(b)-x(a)</m> is also the area under <m>y=v(t)</m>, for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>:
      <me>
        \int_a^b v(t)\,dt = x(b)-x(a)
      </me>,
      where <m>x'(t)=v(t)</m>.
    </p>

    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
    
    <p>
      Technically, this is FTC part 2, even though we're doing it first.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-ftc2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function defined on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be any antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then <m>\di \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b)-F(a)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p pause="yes">
      <em>Notation note:</em> we often write <m>F(x)\Bigr\rvert_a^b = F(b)-F(a)</m> as an intermediate step
      when evaluating a definite integral. First we get the antiderivative,
      and then we plug in the endpoints.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Let's give it a try</title>
    
    <p>
      Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_1^2 (8x-3x^2)\,dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\int_0^{\pi/4}(\sin(x)+\cos(x))\,dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>But why does it work?</title>
    
    <p>
      Let <m>f</m> be continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Let <m>F</m> be an antiderivative of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      and let <m>a=x_0\lt x_1\lt x_2\lt\ldots\lt x_n</m> be a partition of <m>[a,b]</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      On each subinterval <m>[x_{i-1},x_i]</m>, <m>F(x)</m> is continuous, and differentiable.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      By the Mean Value Theorem, there is some <m>c_i\in [x_{i-1},x_i]</m> such that <m>F(x_i)-F(x_{i-1})=F'(c_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Now notice that <m>F'(c_i)(x_i-x_{i-1}) = f(c_i)\Delta x_i</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      So, <m>\di \sum_{i=1}^n f(c_i)\Delta x_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (F(x_{i})-F(x_{i-1})) = F(b)-F(a)</m>.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Less proving, more doing</title>
    
    <p>
      Evaluate the following integral:
      <me>
        \int_0^3 \lvert x^2-2x\rvert \,dx
      </me>.
      <alert>Proceed with caution:</alert> the absolute value is piecewise-defined! 
      You might need an integral property from Section 5.2.
    </p>

    <title>Area between curves</title>
    
    <p>
      If <m>f(x)\geq 0</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      then <m>\int_a^b f(x)\,dx </m> is the area under the graph of <m>f(x)</m> and above the <m>x</m> axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>f(x)</m> is sometimes negative, the integral gives us <q>signed area</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we want to know the area <em>between</em> two curves?
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="45% 20% 35%">
      <stack>
        <p>
          Example: what is the area between <m>y=x</m> and <m>y=x^2-x-3</m>?
        </p>

        <p pause="yes">
          If we were to approximate by rectangles again,
          each rectangle would begin on the graph of <m>f(x)=x^2-x-3</m>,
          and go up to the graph of <m>g(x)=x</m>.
        </p>

        <p pause="yes">
          The height of each rectangle would be <m>g(c_i)-f(c_i)</m>.
        </p>

        <p pause="yes">
          The total area would be <m>\di \int_a^b [g(x)-f(x)]\,dx</m>. (What are <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>?)
        </p>

    <title>Area again</title>
    
    <p>
      A little harder, this time:
    </p>

    <p>
      Find the area that lies between <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m> and <m>g(x)=\cos(x)</m>,
      for <m>0\leq x\leq \pi/2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Hint:</em> which curve is on top? And when?
    </p>

  <slide>
    <title>The other part of the FTC</title>
    
    <p>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus has two parts, and we've seen the second.
    </p>

    <p>
      What's the first part?
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the FTC to evaluate <m>\int_a^b f(x)\,dx</m>, we need an antiderivative.
      Can we always find one?
    </p>

    <p>
      The first part of the FTC says that the answer is <q>yes, but you might not like it</q>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-ftc1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Define a function <m>F</m> as follows:
          <me>
            F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt
          </me>.
          
        </p>

        <p>
          Then <m>F</m> is differentiable on <m>[a,b]</m>, and <m>F'(x)=f(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>An exercise</title>
    
    <p>
      Let <m>\di F(x) = \int_1^x 8t^3\,dt</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      According to part 1 of the FTC, what is <m>F'(x)</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
      A. <m>24t^2\phantom{abcdef}</m> B. <m>24x^2\phantom{abcdef}</m> C. <m>8x^3\phantom{abcdef}</m> D. <m>2x^4</m>
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      If we use part 2 of the FTC, we can also find <m>\di F(x) = 2t^4\bigr\rvert_1^x = 2x^4-2</m>,
      so <m>F'(x)=8x^3</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Which method is faster?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What if you had no other way of coming up with an antiderivative?
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>Some variations on this theme, time permitting</title>
    
    <p>
      If <m>\di F(x) = \int_0^x (t^2+2t\ln(t^2+1))e^{\sin(t^3)-4t}\,dt</m>,
      do we have any hope of using the second part of the FTC?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is <m>F'(x)</m> according to the second part?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What if we had to evaluate <m>\di \int_x^4 \cos(t^2)\,dt</m>, or <m>\di \int_2^{\sin(x)}t^2e^{2t}\,dt</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      How about <m>\di \int_{\sin(x)}^{\cos(x)}e^{-t^2}\,dt</m>?
    </p>
