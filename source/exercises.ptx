      <title>Some <q>Terms and Concepts</q> problems from the book</title>
      
      <p>
        The exercises in each section of APEX begin with 3-6 <q>Terms and Concepts</q> problems.
        These could perhaps be considered reading questions (but I'm not sure they are Beezerian reading questions).
        Most are True/False, Multiple Choice, or Fill in the Blank.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently these are coded as <webwork/> exercises (or not coded at all),
        but they could be converted to Runestone format fairly easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the first three Terms and Concepts problems from Section 1.1 in APEX Calculus.
        The second problem below uses the still-exerimental fill-in-the-blank markup.
        There is support to add feedback for anticipated wrong answers but this isn't documented yet.

              Evaluating the limit of a function at a point is not necessarily the same as evaluating
              the function itself at that point. (Otherwise, there would be no need for the concept of a limit!)

                  For rational functions, as long as the limit of the denominator is non-zero,
                  the quotient property can be applied.

                  Since the limit of the denominator is zero,

                  Limits get tricky any time there is composition,
                  and in this case, the exponent in the exponential function becomes infinite,
                  which is not a situation we've encountered yet.
                  But in terms of limit properties, we run into trouble as soon as we're forced to divide by zero.

              Recall that <m>\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}=1</m>.
              We determined this limit using trigonometry and the Squeeze Theorem,
              since it cannot be evaluated algebraically.

              Now consider the limit <m>\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(2x)}{x}</m>.

                  Unfortunately, very few functions allow you to <q>factor out</q> a constant.
                  The correct identity here is <m>\sin(2x)=2\sin(x)\cos(x)</m>.
                  Using this identity gives another way to evaluate the limit,
                  but this is not a method that extends well to (for example) the limit of <m>\frac{\sin(7x)}{x}</m>.
