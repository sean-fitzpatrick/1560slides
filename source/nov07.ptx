      This was the day for optimization problems.

      I believe we did:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The minimum surface area of a box with fixed volume, if the length is three times the width
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            The area of the largest rectangle that can fit under the parabola <m>y=4-x^2</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A third problem that I can't seem to remember.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
