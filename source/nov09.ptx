    <title>One last example</title>
    
    <p>
      During the summers, Sean sells Texas watermelons out of the
      back of a truck along Highway 3, near Taber, AB. 
      During the previous summer, he sold his watermelons for $15 each,
      and sold an average of 50 watermelons per day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sean hired group of students at the Dhillon School of Business to conduct a market research survey. 
      They found that for every $1 reduction in the price of his watermelons, 
      Sean would sell an additional 5 watermelons per day.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Let <m>x</m> amount by which Sean reduces the price of each watermelon.
      What is the correct formula for the revenue <m>R</m>, as a function of <m>x</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is the applied domain for <m>R(x)</m>?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      At what price should Sean sell his watermelons in order to maximize revenue from his watermelon business?
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      <em>Homework:</em> If it costs Sean $7.15 per watermelon to get his melons from a wholesaler,
      find a formula for the profit <m>P(x)</m> as a function of the reduction in price.
      At what price should Sean sell his melons if he wants to maximize profit, rather than revenue?
      Are you surprised by the answer?

    <title>And now for something new: tangent lines</title>
    
    <p>
      Recall: given a graph <m>y=f(x)</m> of a differentiable function <m>f</m>,
      the <term>tangent line</term> to the graph at a point <m>(c,f(c))</m> is
      <me>
        y = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The function whose graph gives the tangent line is called the <term>linearization</term>
      of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>:
      <me>
        \ell(x) = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)
      </me>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      An exercise: what is the linearization of <m>f(x)=x^2\sqrt{x-1}</m> at <m>2</m>?
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ell(x)=2+6(x-4)</m>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\ell(x)=4+6(x-2)</m>

    <title>Differentials</title>
    
    <sidebyside widths="40% 10% 50%">
      <p>
        The point of the tangent line (AKA linearization) is twofold:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              It's linear, and therefore simple.
            </p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <p>
              As long as <m>\Delta x = x-c</m> is small,
              <m>\ell(x)</m> is a good approximation of <m>f(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <image source="images/differential.png" width="100%"/>
    </sidebyside>

    <p>
      If <m>x = c + \Delta x</m>, and <m>y=f(x)</m>, we set:
      <md>
        <mrow>\Delta y \amp = f(x)-f(c) = f(c+\Delta x)-f(c)</mrow>
        <mrow>dy \amp = \ell(x)-\ell(c) = f'(c)\Delta x</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Note that if <m>f(x)=x</m>, we get <m>y=x</m>,
      and <m>dx = f'(c)\Delta x = \Delta x</m>, since <m>f'(x)=1</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      This means we can use <m>dx</m> and <m>\Delta x</m> interchangeably.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      But the same is not true of <m>dy</m> and <m>\Delta y</m>!
      However, we <em>can</em> say that <m>\Delta y \approx dy</m>,
      if <m>\Delta x</m> is small.

    <title>An approximation</title>
    
    <p>
      <em>Problem:</em> Use linear approximation to estimate the value of <m>\sqrt{4.2}</m>.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      We will be finding the linearization <m>\ell(x)</m> of some function <m>f(x)</m>.
      What function should we use?
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=x^2</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=2x</m>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>


    <p pause="yes">
      We need to choose a point at which to compute the linearization.
      What point should we use? (i.e., what value of <m>c</m>?)
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      What is the <em>approximate</em> value of <m>\sqrt{4.2}</m>?

    <title>Differentials, again</title>
    
    <p>
      Given <m>y=f(x)</m>, and no particular point of interest,
      we write the differential of <m>y</m> as
      <me>
        dy = f'(x)\,dx
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      What is the differential of <m>y = \sin(x^3)</m>?
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = \cos(3x^2)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = \cos(3x^2)\,dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = 3x^2\cos(x^3)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>dy = 3x^2\cos(x^3)\,dx</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Differentials will be important in the next unit,
      when we consider change of variables for integrals.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Differentials can also be used for <q>propogation of error</q> calculations.
      For example, the area of a circle is <m>A = \pi r^2</m>.
      Taking differentials gives <m>dA = 2\pi r\,dr</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      If we measure the radius of the circle to be 15 cm, 
      with a possible error in measurement of <m>\pm 0.1</m> cm,
      then the possible error in the calculated area is approximately
      <m>dA = 2\pi (15)(0.1) = 3\pi</m>.

    <title>Improving the linear approximation</title>
    
    <p>
      When a linear approximation isn't good enough, 
      we can consider adding in higher-order corrections.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the graph <m>y=f(x)</m> is concave down at <m>c</m>,
      will the linear approximation <m>\ell(x)</m> at <m>c</m>
      give an overestimate, or an underestimate? 
    </p>

    <p>
      What if the graph is concave up?
    </p>

    <p>
      To account for this, we can add a <q>second-order correction</q>.
      That is, we can look for a <em>quadratic approximation</em>
      <me>
        q(x) = A+B(x-c)+C(x-c)^2
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      We want <m>q(c)=f(c)</m>, so <m>A=f(c)</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      We want <m>q'(c)=f'(c)</m> (it seemed like a good idea for the linear approximation),
      so <m>B = f'(c)</m>. (Notice that <m>q'(x)=B+2C(x-c)</m>.)
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      It seems reasonable for the quadratic approximation to agree with the concavity of <m>f(x)</m>,
      so we ask that <m>q''(c)=f''(c)</m>, which implies <m>2C=f''(c)</m>, or <m>C = \frac{f''(c)}{2}</m>.
    </p>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <title>A quadratic approximation</title>
    
    <p>
      We just found that a quadratic approximation to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>c</m> is
      <me>
        q(x) = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)+\frac{f''(c)}{2}(x-c)^2
      </me>.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      What is the quadratic approximation to <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m> at <m>4</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that we already found the linear approximation <m>\ell(x)=2+\frac14(x-4)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol marker="A.">
        <li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>q(x) = -\dfrac{1}{64}(x-4)^2</m>

          <p>

          <p>

          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Using the quadratic approximation, we find <m>\sqrt{4.2}\approx 2.049875</m>.

    <title>Taylor polynomials</title>
    
    <p>
      The continuation of this process of adding higher-order corrections leads
      to what are called <term>Taylor polynomials</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a function <m>f(x)</m> such that derivatives of <m>f</m> of all orders exist at <m>c</m>,
      the degree <m>n</m> Taylor polynomial of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> is
      <me>
        p_n(x) = f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)+\frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x-c)^2+\frac{f'''(c)}{3!}(x-c)^3+\cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n
      </me>.
      The special case when <m>c=0</m> is called a <term>Maclaurin polynomial</term>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Note that <m>f^{(n)}(c)</m> means the <m>n</m>th derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>,
      and <m>n!</m> is the <term>factorial</term> of <m>n</m>:
      the product of all integers from 1 to <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p pause="yes">
      Note <m>1!=1</m>, <m>2! = 1(2)=2</m>, <m>3! = 1(2)(3)=6</m>, <m>4! = 1(2)(3)(4)=24</m>, and so on.

      Earlier, we found that the degree 2 Taylor polynomial of <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m> at 4 is
      <me>
        p_2(x) = 2 + \frac14(x-2)-\frac{1}{64}(x-2)^2
      </me>,
      since <m>f(4)=\sqrt{4}=2</m>, <m>f'(4)=\frac12 (4)^{-1/2} = \frac14</m>, and <m>f''(4)=-\frac14 (4)^{-3/2} = \frac{1}{32}</m>
