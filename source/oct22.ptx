      Let <m>f(x) = x^2(x-4)^3</m>.

          <p>
            What are the critical points of <m>f</m>?

        <li>
          <p>
            On what intervals is <m>f</m> increasing/decreasing?

        <li>
          <p>
            For each critical point of <m>f</m>, determine if it is a local maximum, local minimum, or neither.

    <title>Concavity</title>
    
    <p>
      The <q>concavity of a graph</q> has to do with its curvature:
      in what way does the graph deviate from a straight line?
    </p>

      <ul pause="yes">
        <li>
          <p>
            If the graph of a function <m>f</m> curves upward, we say it is <term>concave up</term>.
            <ul pause="yes">
              <li>
                <p>
                  When the graph of <m>f</m> is concave up, secant lines lie <em>above</em> the graph,
                  and tangent lines (where they exist) lie <em>below</em> the graph.
                </p>

    <title>Finding intervals of concavity</title>
    
    <p>
      Find the intervals on which the graph of <m>f(x)=x^4-4x^3</m> is concave up,
      and the intervals on which the graph is concave down.

    <title>Second derivative test</title>
    
    <p>
      Suppose <m>f</m> is a differentiable function.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a local minimum, the graph should be concave up: <m>f''(x)\gt 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a local maximum, the graph should be concave down: <m>f''(x)\lt 0</m>.
